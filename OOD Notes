Encapsulation - binding the data together and hiding it from the outside world. This can be achieved by keeping state and functions private, thus the state 
can only be accessed through public functions. 

Abstraction - Natural extension of encapsulation. Hiding all but the relevant data about an object ot reduce the compelxity of the system. Basically keep it as a 
need to know basis, the user does not need to know how the function will do it job, simply, it can kind of blindly assume that the operation will be performed. 
Internal implmentations details of objects r hiden and only revealing operations that are relevant to other objects. 

Inheritance - creating new classes from existing ones. Examples of this may be we have a parent class called Vehicles, we can have multiple children of Vehicles like 
Car, Truck, Bike that inherit certain properties from parent (vehicle). 

Polymorphism - object to take many form. For example, in a chess OOD we may have a Piece, now every Piece may have a move, but there may be different moves 
based on the form (bishop, castle, knight). 


## OO Analysis and Design

The first step in object oriented design is identifiying the objects in the crtiera and coming up with the interaction between them. 
The steps in OO can be descrbied as: 
1. Identify the objects in a system 
2. Define the relationship between the objects 
3. Establish the interface of each object 
4. Make design which can be converted to executabes using OO languages

There are different ways to represent OO interactions. 
1) Use Case Diagram - describe the set of user scenarios -> 
2) Class Diagram - structure and behavior in the use cases, provides conceptual model of the system in terms of entites and their relationships 
3) Activity Diagram - the funnctional flow of control between two or more class objects 
4) Sequence Diagram - Used to describe interaction among classes in terms of exchagne of messages over time
